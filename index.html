      Hi, my name is Aarya T, and welcome to my website! I enjoy traveling and going to various new places to see all of the different scenes nature has to offer. While I enjoy going out, I also like to stay in my room cozy in a blanket and watch a movie. Arts and crafts are a big part of my life since I enjoy doing them whenever possible. I like painting, drawing, and also making different sculptures with cardboard. Computer science has always been of interest to me because I started coding at an early age. Problem solving and teamwork are a very big part of coding and thats what makes it a good challenge.
