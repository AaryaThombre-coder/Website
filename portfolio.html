        Girls who code: I took part in a GWC Summer Program where my friends and I created a robot and competed against other teams. At first, we had to over come various challenges and it came to a point when we thought we wouldnt pass the first rank to move on to the next level. We kept pushing and improving our code that we managed to get into the finals and got third place.
